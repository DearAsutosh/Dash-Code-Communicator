## 1. Problem Statement:

 In military and rescue operations, silent communication is often critical.
   Conventional wireless communication devices can be detected, jammed, or may
   draw unnecessary attention. A simple Morse code-based wearable communicator
   can provide a low-cost, silent, and effective solution for transmitting
   short messages.

## 2. Core Concept:
   - A soldier wears a small wrist device with a single push button.
   - Short press = dot (·), Long press = dash (–).
   - Each tap is transmitted wirelessly in real-time to a central system.
   - The central receiver (Node.js server) decodes the Morse code into
     human-readable text.
   - The decoded message is displayed on a web dashboard accessible to other
     soldiers or commanders.
