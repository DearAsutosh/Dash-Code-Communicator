# Why Extra Components Are Needed

## ðŸ”Œ Resistors
1. **10 kÎ© (pull-up / pull-down):**
   - **Reason:** Prevents the input pin from "floating" and giving random HIGH/LOW signals.
   - Without it â†’ ESP32 may randomly detect button presses (false signals).

2. **220 Î© (for LEDs):**
   - **Reason:** Limits the current flowing through the LED and protects the ESP32 pin.
   - Without it â†’ LED may burn out or the ESP32 pin may overheat.

3. **1 kÎ© (for transistor base):**
   - **Reason:** Controls the current going into the transistor from the ESP32.
   - Without it â†’ transistor or ESP32 pin can get damaged.

---

## ðŸ”„ Flyback Diode (with transistor + motor/buzzer)
- **Reason:** Protects the ESP32 from voltage spikes caused when motors/buzzers are switched OFF.
- Without it â†’ ESP32 can **get damaged or die instantly** due to high-voltage kickbacks.

---

## ðŸ“Ÿ Multimeter
- **Reason:** Helps check voltages, continuity, and connections to quickly find problems.
- Without it â†’ debugging takes hours of guesswork instead of minutes.
