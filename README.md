## 🌟 Project Overview
**Dash Code Communicator** is an innovative wireless communication system designed for quick, efficient, and secure message transmission using a unique dash-based coding system. It combines hardware 🛠️ and software 💻 components to provide a seamless messaging experience for IoT and real-world applications, especially where conventional typing or texting may not be practical.

## ❗ Problem Statements
- ⏳ **Slow manual communication:** Typing long messages can be time-consuming in constrained or high-pressure environments.  
- 📶 **Offline communication limitations:** Standard messaging apps require internet connectivity.  
- ⚡ **Signal ambiguity:** Existing wireless text communication systems can suffer from delays or misinterpretation.  
- 🔧 **Hardware constraints:** Many setups require multiple input devices or complex configurations.  
- 📈 **Scalability challenges:** Real-time communication across multiple devices while keeping it simple is difficult.

## 💡 Our Solutions
- 📝 Developed a **custom Dash Code mapping** system for faster transmission (2–3 symbols per character).  
- 🔘 Built a **single-button hardware transmitter** using ESP32 for taps and long presses.  
- 📡 Implemented a **wireless receiver** to decode messages in real-time.  
- 🖥️ Integrated a **Node.js + Express backend** for message handling and storage.  
- ☁️ Used **MongoDB Atlas** for persistent device and message data.  
- ⚡ Added **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for live updates on the frontend.  
- 🏗️ Designed a **modular architecture** for easy scalability and maintainability.
